            <p>
                I am in my 4th year of Computing Science at the University of Alberta, with 
                an anticipated graduation date of April, 2021. I am passionate about programming 
                and solving problems, ready to work in any language necessary to get the job done. In my free 
                time, I enjoys working out, knitting, and rewatching Star Trek.
            </p>

            <h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I have been working with HTML and CSS for over 5 years now and started my official programming 
                journey 4 years ago at the University of Alberta. I have worked at 3 different startup companies 
                in Edmonton, AB; I most recently finished an 8-month internship with Drivewyze. In my role at 
                Drivewyze, I worked in JavaScript, Python, .NET Core, C++, and LISP to create a test harness 
                that continues to be used by the developers. I later adapted this harness to work with continuous 
                integration so as to provide maximum impact. In the past, I have worked primarily in JavaScript 
                and Python, as well as Flutter when it was still in its early days.
            </p>

            <h2 id="potential">Potential</h2>
            <p>
                Wherever I goes, I bring an enthusiastic attitude and a positive outlook on all tasks. I 
                am honing her leardership skills by taking charge of group projects and meetings and I love 
                learning new leardership and programming skills. I speak 4 languages (English, French, Spanish, 
                and German), so communication is never a barrier. In addition, I have a strong social compass, 
                and am always looking for ways to make the workplace more inviting and diverse.
